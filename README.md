# krmcbride dockerfiles

This repository contains various Dockerfiles which are "opinionated" flavors of the original official images. 

For example, "base" images are typically the official version with a few minor additions like vim.tiny and a decent bashrc, while the "dev" version will build off base with more advanced vim, zsh and git configurations, etc.
